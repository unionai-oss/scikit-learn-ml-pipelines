    "This tutorial will walk you through building an end-to-end machine learning pipeline using scikit-learn and Union's AI workflow and inference platform. We'll download a dataset, train a machine learning model, deploy it, and track its artifacts using Union's powerful MLOps features. Although this example may seem relatively simple, all the concepts and tools used here can be applied to more complex machine learning and AI projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "By just adding a few lines of code to your Python functions, you'll be able to create a reproducible ML pipeline, taking advantage of Union's features:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reproducible AI workflows: Ensure your ML pipeline produces the same environments every time.\n",
    "- Versioning of code and artifacts: Track changes in your code and models automatically.\n",
    "- Data Caching for faster iterations: Reuse results from previous executions to save time.\n",
    "- Declarative Infrastructure: Define your ML infrastructure needs directly in your code without worrying about provisioning.\n",
    "- Artifact Management for models and data: Automatically manage your model files and datasets.\n",
    "- Container Image Builder: Build and deploy your code in a consistent environment.\n",
    "- Local Development: Test your workflows locally before deploying them to the cloud.\n",
    "- Actors for long-running stateful containers: Handle tasks that require continuous state or interaction.\n",
    "- And more...\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Note: This section we register tasks and workflows directly in the notebook cells. This is powerful for prototyping and testing and allows you to create and run reproducible workflows without leaving the notebook! However, most people will probably prefer to define tasks in a separate file and import them into workflows, which we will do in the next section."
